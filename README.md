Welcome to the **100 Days of Java Programming** challenge! 🚀

This repository documents a journey of consistent learning and coding in Java. Whether you are a beginner looking to start your programming journey or an experienced developer brushing up on core concepts, this collection provides structured, daily practice to master the language.

## 🌟 Why This Repository?

- **Structured Learning**: Follows a day-by-day progression from basics to advanced topics.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Understand not just syntax, but *why* specific data types and structures are used in production software (e.g., memory optimization with `byte` vs `int`).
- **Interview Prep**: Covers fundamental concepts often asked in technical interviews.
- **Hands-on Practice**: Each day includes runnable code examples.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Progress

| **[Day 3](Day-3-short/)** | **Short Data Type** | 16-bit integers, specific use cases | ✅ Completed |
| **[Day 4](Day-4-integer-data_type/)** | **Integer Data Type** | Standard counting, arithmetic | ✅ Completed |
| **[Day 5](Day-5-float-data-type/)** | **Float Data Type** | Decimal precision, floating-point math | ✅ Completed |
| **[Day 6](Day-6-char-data-type/)** | **Char Data Type** | ASCII, Unicode characters | ✅ Completed |
| **[Day 7](Day-7-double/)** | **Double Data Type** | High-precision decimals | ✅ Completed |
| **[Day 8](Day-8-Boolean/)** | **Boolean Data Type** | Logic gates, True/False flags | ✅ Completed |

| ... | ... | ... | 🚧 In Progress |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher.
  - [Download Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).
- A code editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/subhasish20/100-Days-of-Java-Programming.git
    cd 100-Days-of-Java-Programming
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific day**:
    ```bash
    cd Day-1-Intro
    ```

3.  **Compile and Run**:
    ```bash
    javac hello_word.java
    java hello_word
    ```
    *(Note: Filenames may vary per day. Check the file list in each folder.)*

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

- **Byte/Short**: Used in embedded systems or file processing where memory conservation is critical.
- **Float/Double**: Essential for scientific calculations, graphics rendering, and financial applications (use `BigDecimal` for currency!).
- **Boolean**: The backbone of control flow, decision making, and feature flags in modern apps.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug, have a better example, or want to add a new day's challenge:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/Day-11-Strings`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to the branch.
5.  Open a Pull Request.
